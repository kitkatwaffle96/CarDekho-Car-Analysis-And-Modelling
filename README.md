**CarDekho-Car-Analysis-And-Modelling**

**Overview**

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about second-hand cars listed on CarDekho. The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build machine learning models to derive insights and make predictions about car prices.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains various features related to second-hand cars, such as age, kilometers driven, mileage, engine capacity, maximum power, and selling price.

**Data Cleaning and EDA Summary**

**Distributions**: Histograms and box plots for numerical columns such as vehicle_age, km_driven, mileage, engine, max_power, seats, and selling_price were generated to understand their distributions and detect any outliers.

**Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix and heatmap were created to understand the relationships between numerical features.

**Price** **Analysis**:

The distribution of selling prices was analyzed.
Selling prices were compared across different car brands.
